## How It Works
The plugin works by running the /connection command on every dimension load. It then takes the game name by the "SERVER-NAME" text in the chat and then filters out the numbers in the text. 
It then stores the game name as the current game. It then detects for "Game" or "Victory" text in the title event, and if its shown it will then queue to the next game. 

Currently, the plugin only works for Victory screen and will not work for auto queue on death. This is done in favor of the upcoming party system to the plugin.
